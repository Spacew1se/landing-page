# landing-page
A landing page styled with flexbox

I had a great time and a few headaches due to margin and padding during this 
exercise, but I learned a lot by playing around with different elements and 
inspecting flexboxes with the browser dev tools.

I can't wait to learn about responsive design so that my sites will be beautiful 
on every device!
